Learning how to update, delete, access keys and values in both dictionaries and lists


1. Update values in dictionaries and lists
   - change the value 10 in x to 15. Once you're done x should now be [5,2,3], [15,8,9]
   - change the last_name of the first student from 'Jordan' to 'Bryant'
   - in the sports_directory, change 'Messi' to 'Andres'
   - change the value 20 in z to 30

2. iterate through a list of dictionaries
   create a function iterateDictionary(some_list) that, given a list of dictionaries, the function loops
   through each dictionary in the list and prints each key and the associated value.

3. get values from a list of dictionaries
   create a function itirateDictionary2(key_name, some_list) that, given a list of dictionaries and a key
   name, the function prints the value stored in that key for each dictionary.

4. iterate through a dictionary with list values
   create a function printInfo(some_dict) that given a dictionary whose values are all lists, prints the name
   of each key along with the size of its list, and the prints the associated values within each key's list.
